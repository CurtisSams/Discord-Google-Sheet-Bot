# Discord-Google-Sheet-Bot
This was designed to read peoples DKP(score) from a google speadsheet.

This was mostly an adaptation of the developerjs tutorial bot and then throwing in the googlesheets access tutorial, though with a few tweaks to run off an existing google api account. Where you will need to place your details I have shown in the code itself. 


Requirements

Discord developer portal access
Google API access (Google API does charge for its calls, please look into it before signing up)
Node.js 
Discord.js 
(I recommend googling the discordjs guide if you need help installing these two. The guide is excellent and if this is your first bot it helps you create the bot and understand its functions)

TBC
